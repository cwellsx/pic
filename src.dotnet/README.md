Beware there are many clones of the `WindowsAPICodePack` package:

- https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=WindowsAPICodePack

Note:

1. I ignore the first on the list i.e. `WindowsAPICodePack` because it has no CHANGELOG and no commit messages

   - https://github.com/Wagnerp/Windows-API-CodePack-NET

2. I ignore the second i.e. `WindowsAPICodePack-Core` because it's the parent of the other clones but not updated since
   2016

   - https://github.com/aybe/Windows-API-Code-Pack-1.1

3. I therefore choose the third i.e. `Microsoft-WindowsAPICodePack-Core`

   - https://github.com/contre/Windows-API-Code-Pack-1.1

4. However `Microsoft-WindowsAPICodePack-Core` hasn't been updated since Jan 6, 2021 -- if necessary there's a more
   recent fork of that, which is packaged as `Microsoft-WindowsAPICodePack-Core-6.0`

   - https://github.com/samypr100/Windows-API-Code-Pack-1.1

There are others with slightly different names, e.g. `Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack-Core` etc.

Another which I might try, if the first one I tried doesn't work, is `WinCopies.WindowsAPICodePack`.
