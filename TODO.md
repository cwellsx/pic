# To do

The purpose of this list to delay until later what isn't needed immediately.

## Now

Minimal behaviour:

- Set status text - renderer
- Create thumbnails - core
- Display thumbnails - renderer
- Read metadata - core
- Save metadata - main
- Display metadata - renderer

## Later

### More features

- Export
- Search
- Tags

### Docking

Use a layout manager with dockable panels -- for example:

- https://npm.io/package/flexlayout-react
- https://github.com/caplin/FlexLayout#alternative-layout-managers

### Electron Forge v6.0.0

Per https://github.com/electron/forge/releases/tag/v6.0.0 there are some breaking changes in the
v6.0.0 compared to the late beta version that I'm currently using in this project.

I should also update my 'resource plugin' and 'template' project.

## Done

Application template:

- Architecture
- Build tools
